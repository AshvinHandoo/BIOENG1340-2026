See [Week09/README.md](Week09/README.md). |
| [Project](Project/) | Team project topic discussions | Project framework, dataset sources, and the running record of team/topic discussions. See [Project/README.md](Project/README.md). |

## Working with the data

- The `Week01/images/` folder contains the sample **pig cardiac MRI** dataset
  (DICOM stack, NIfTI, VTK, STL, and ParaView state files).
- Large installers (e.g. the ITK-SNAP `.dmg`) are **not** tracked in git; see
  [.gitignore](.gitignore). Download tools directly from their official sites.

## Tools used

- **MATLAB** — DICOM I/O, image processing, VTK export
- **Python** with **SimpleITK** — DICOM series reading and processing
- **ITK-SNAP** — segmentation
- **ParaView** — 3D volume / surface visualization
